# Task 1: Financial Data Extraction & Trend Analysis

This task involved extracting and analyzing key financial data from SEC filings to inform the development of an AI-powered financial chatbot. The analysis was completed using Python and pandas in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

# Objective

Manually extract financial data for Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple from the past three 10-K filings. Analyze trends over time using Python to uncover insights that could shape chatbot logic and user-facing responses.

# Key Financial Metrics

For each company, the following metrics were collected from 10-K filings:

- Total Revenue  
- Net Income  
- Total Assets  
- Total Liabilities  
- Cash Flow from Operating Activities  

# Steps Followed

## 1. Manual Data Extraction
- Accessed the SEC EDGAR database.
- Located the latest three 10-K filings for Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple.
- Extracted the five required metrics per fiscal year.
- Compiled the data into an Excel spreadsheet for easier analysis.

## 2. Python Setup & Jupyter Notebook
- Installed and launched Jupyter Notebook:
  ```bash
  pip install notebook
  jupyter notebook
  ```
- Created a new notebook for this task.

## 3. Data Analysis Using Pandas
- Converted the Excel file to CSV for easier handling.
- Loaded the data into a pandas DataFrame:
  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  df = pd.read_csv('financial_data.csv')
  ```
- Calculated year-over-year percentage changes:
  ```python
  df['Revenue Growth (%)'] = df.groupby(['Company'])['Total Revenue'].pct_change() * 100
  df['Net Income Growth (%)'] = df.groupby(['Company'])['Net Income'].pct_change() * 100
  ```
- Explored other metrics and groupings to identify financial trends.

## 4. Documentation & Export
- Used markdown cells in Jupyter to explain the methodology, trends, and insights.
- Exported the final notebook as PDF/HTML for submission.
