                                       Documentation: AI Financial Chatbot

 --> How It Works:
- The chatbot retrieves financial data based on predefined rule-based logic.

- It matches user input to known financial queries and returns the correct data.

- Data is extracted from the financial analysis CSV from previous steps.

 --> Queries It Can Answer:
The chatbot can respond to predefined financial queries such as:

"What is the total revenue?"

"How has net income changed over the last year?"

"What are the total assets for [Company] in [Year]?"

"What is Tesla's cash flow from operations for 2023?"

 -->Limitations:
Not an AI-powered chatbot: Uses simple if-else logic instead of NLP.

Canâ€™t handle variations: Must match predefined queries exactly.

No live data: It works only with the dataset provided.

No user intent detection: Cannot understand different phrasings of the same question.
