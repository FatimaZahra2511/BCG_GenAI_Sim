**Organization:** Boston Consulting Group (BCG)

## Overview

This repository contains my completed work for the **BCG GenAI Job Simulation**, hosted on Forage. The simulation offered a hands-on experience in the development of AI-powered tools within a consulting context, focusing on the use of generative AI to enhance financial data accessibility and interpretation for clients.

## Project Description

As part of BCGâ€™s GenAI Consulting team simulation, I developed a prototype financial chatbot powered by rule-based logic and Python. The goal was to assist clients in understanding complex financial reports (e.g., 10-K and 10-Q filings) through intuitive and accessible analysis.

## Key Tasks

- Parsed and analyzed financial data from SEC filings.
- Built rule-based logic for chatbot responses based on company-specific financial insights.
- Wrote Python scripts using `pandas` for data extraction and manipulation.
- Simulated chatbot interactions to demonstrate usability and clarity of financial output.

## Skills & Tools

- **Python**: Data manipulation and logic implementation.
- **Pandas**: Extracting, transforming, and analyzing structured financial data.
- **Generative AI Concepts**: Applying AI thinking to real-world consulting challenges.
- **Business Communication**: Translating raw data into actionable insights for clients.
